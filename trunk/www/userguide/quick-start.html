            other databases are supported out of the box, but will be soon. Once you have Postgres
            installed, create a user called "openatna" with the password "openatna". Postgres usually comes
            with PGAdmin which allows you to do this in a gui. From the command line, it would look
            like this:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">
psql -d template1 -U postgres
Password for user postgres: 
psql (8.4.0)
Type "help" for help.

template1=# CREATE USER openatna WITH PASSWORD 'openatna';
            </pre><p>Next, create the data base, also called 'openatna'. On the command line:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">
template1=# CREATE DATABASE openatna
WITH OWNER = openatna
ENCODING = 'UTF8'
LC_COLLATE = 'C'
LC_CTYPE = 'C'
CONNECTION LIMIT = -1;
            </pre><p> To install OpenATNA, open a terminal window and download the code using svn:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">svn co https://openatna.projects.openhealthtools.org/svn/openatna/trunk openatna</pre><p>
            This will create a directory called "openatna" in the directory from which you opened
            the terminal window.</p><p> change directory into the new "openatna" directory.
            </p><pre class="programlisting">cd openatna</pre><p> You should see two sub directories:
                        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>www</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>openatna</p></li></ul></div><p>
            change directory to the "openatna" sub-directory. You should see a bunch of directories
            and a file called "pom.xml". The pom file is what maven uses to build the project. </p><p> now build the project using maven by typing:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">mvn install</pre><p> To create a project for eclipse type:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">mvn eclipse:eclipse</pre><p> To create one for intellij, type:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">mvn idea:idea</pre><p> These commands will create project files
            for your IDE. </p><p> The code is compiled and packaged into modules. The "all" directory contains a module
            that generates a useable version of OpenATNA. Change directory into the all/build
            folder. You should see a jar file called openatna-0.1.jar. This is the
            executable jar file. The dependencies are in the lib/ directory. To run OpenATNA, type:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">java -jar openatna-0.1.jar</pre><p> from the all/build
            directory. You should see something similar to:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">

            described below. They allow you change the configuration of OpenATNA without
            re-compiling, although they do require that you shut the servers down, and restart them
            so the chages can take effect. To kill the servers, hit Control + C.

            you want to add functionality beyond the simple default behaviour of OpenATNA when audit
            messages arrive. The message processing is organized as a chain of
            org.openhealthtools.openatna.audit.process.AtnaProcessors. These are given a chance at
            processing the Message on its inward journey. The message chain creates a ProcessContext
            object that contains the message, a set of configurable properties (a Map), as well as
            the current state of context.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Currently, the process of deploying external processors described below requires that you run the build again ("mvn install")
            after you have followed the above instructions. This means you should edit the IheActors.xml file in the
            <span class="bold"><strong>openatna/audit/src/main/resources/conf/</strong></span> directory, not the one in the
            <span class="bold"><strong>openatna/all/build/conf/</strong></span> directory, and then run "mvn install"</p></div><p>By default, OpenATNA contains three processors. The first validates the incoming message and sets
            the context state to VALIDATED if validation succeeds. The second persists the message and sets
            the context state to PERSISTED. The third logs exceptions that may occur.
        </p><p>The AtnaProcessor interface is shown below.</p><pre class="programlisting">

            * the exception that was thrown.

            public void error(ProcessContext context);
            
        }            
        </pre><p>Processors can be associated with a phase of processing. Currently three phases are supported:
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>PRE_VERIFY - processors are invoked before the message has be verified.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>POST_VERIFY - processors are invoked after the message has been verified, but before
                    it has been persisted. This is the default phase, meaning if no phase attribute is specified,
                    then the processor will be placed in this phase.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>POST_PERSIST - processors are invoked after the message has been persisted to the data base.</p></li></ul></div><p>
            If the default validator is used, this is always run at the beginning of the chain so
            application specific processors know the message has been validated unless they are added as part of
            the PRE_VERIFY phase. If no processor is
            added that sets the ProcessContext's state to PERSISTED, then the default
            PersistenceProcessor is added after the processors defined below within the POST_VERIFY phase.
            For business logic, it is advisable to add processors to the POST_PERSIST phase because if the processor
            gets invoked, it can be sure that the message has been validated and persisted without errors.
            
        </p><p>Once you have written your processors, you need to deploy them to OpenATNA so that
        it is picked up at runtime. If you are integrating OpenATNA with your environment in a environment
        specific way, then simple add the processors to the environment class path and follow the
        String XML configuration instructions below. If you are using the default build process described in this
        document, i.e., running OpenATNA from the command line, then you need to
        drop the jar into
        the <span class="bold"><strong>openatna/all/ext</strong></span> directory. This allows them to be picked up by the build
            and added to the executable jar's classpath. You can also add the jar to the <span class="bold"><strong>all/build/</strong></span>
            directory, but be aware that it will be deleted the next time you run "mvn clean".
            
        To configure the system to use the processors, you need to edit
        the <span class="bold"><strong>openatnaContext.xml</strong></span> file to add the processors to the processing chain.
        
        This involves declaring the full class name of the processors you want to include within a list inside the
        bean with an id of "serviceConfig". 
        The snippet below shows an example of the XML should be added as a child of the "serviceConfig" bean.
        In this example, the processor is added to the POST_PERSIST phase of processing. Multiple processors
        can be added using the "value" tag.

            Supplied AtnaProcessors must implement the
            org.openhealthtools.openatna.audit.process.AtnaProcessor interface and should have a
            default constructor.

The well-known types are defined in the <span class="bold"><strong>
            atnacodes.xml
        </strong></span> file and are loaded by default. To add you own, either edit the default codes file, or add
        other files containing codes. To add new files, edit the <span class="bold"><strong>openatnaContext.xml</strong></span>
        file, in particular the bean with the id "serviceConfig", similar to adding processors. The list of code files
        is a set of strings that will be used to create URL objects. Below is an example of adding two custom code URLs
        to the "serviceConfig" bean.

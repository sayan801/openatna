<h2>Install and Build</h2>
<p>Prerequisites: </p>
<ul>
<li>a Subversion (svn) client</li>
<li>Java 1.5 minimum</li>
<li>Apache's Maven</li>
<li>Postgres RDBMS</li>
</ul>


<p>First, set up your database. OpenATNA is tested against Postres 8.4. Currently not other databases are supported out of the box, but will be soon. Once you have Postgres installed, create a user called "atna" with the password "atna". Postgres usually comes with PGAdmin which allows you to do this in a gui. From the command line, it would look like this: </p>
<pre>
psql -d template1 -U postgres 
Password for user postgres:  psql (8.4.0)
 Type "help" for help.

template1=# CREATE USER atna WITH PASSWORD 'atna';
</pre>

<p>Next, create the data base. On the command line: </p>
<pre>
template1=# CREATE DATABASE atna WITH OWNER = atna ENCODING = 'UTF8' LC_COLLATE = 'C' LC_CTYPE = 'C' CONNECTION LIMIT = -1;
</pre>

<p>To install OpenATNA, open a terminal window and download the code using svn: </p>

<pre>
svn co https://openatna.projects.openhealthtools.org/svn/openatna/trunk openatna
</pre>

<p>This will create a directory called "openatna" in the directory from which you opened the terminal window.</p>
<p>change directory into the new "openatna" directory. </p>
<pre>
cd openatna
</pre>

<p>You should see two sub directories: </p>
<ul><li>www</li>
<li>openatna</li>
</ul>

<p>change directory to the "openatna" sub-directory. You should see a bunch of directories and a file called "pom.xml". The pom file is what maven uses to build the project. </p>
<p>now build the project using maven by typing: </p>
<pre>
mvn -P exec install
</pre>

<p>To create a project for eclipse type: </p>
<pre>
mvn eclipse:eclipse
</pre>
<p>To create one for intellij, type: </p>
<pre>
mvn idea:idea
</pre>
<p>These commands will create project files for your IDE. </p>

<p>The code is compiled and packaged into modules. The "all" directory contains a module that generates a useable version of OpenATNA. Change directory into the all/build folder. You should see a jar file called openatna-0.1.jar. This is the executable jar file. The dependencies are in the lib/ directory. To run OpenATNA, type: </p>

<pre>
java -jar openatna-0.1.jar
</pre>

<p>from the all/build directory. You should see something similar to: </p>

<pre>
12:56:59,233 DEBUG [TcpServer] TLS Server running on port:2862
12:56:59,262 DEBUG [UdpServer] UDP Server running on port:2863
</pre>

<p>This has started two servers. The first is a secured TCP server socket. The second is an unsecured UDP connection. The port numbers are not completely random - "ATNA" on your mobile phone is 2862.</p>
